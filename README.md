# idiot-filter

this is a personally tailored python script that listens to incoming messages and blocks users depending on certain conditions 

**yes that's against TOS, but this does not send any message and always keeps an offline status. also all blocks are queued and randomly spread across 5 minutes slices.**

## conditions 

- block anyone with hoisted nick sending a message
- block anyone with certain country flags in name
- block anyone mentioning me in the vencord support channel
- block anyone mentioning anyone in the vc support channel
- block anyone dming me for what seems like vc support if no relationship 
- block anyone sending @here or @everyone with no relationship
- block any steam scammer
